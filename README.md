CPP-Project1_GeometricConsoleApplication - 2D Shapes

Instructions:
1. Create a console app w/C++ for 2D shapes and their properties 
2. Use switch case – to select the shape from user (cyclic --> use do-while case)
3. Create custom namespace
4. Only header files (.h) must be included in main.cpp
5. Each shape must have its own .h file
6. Shapes - Line, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse 

Steps:
1. Create a separate header and cpp file for each shape
2. All header files should be in “deaders” folder and all cpp files (except main.cpp) should be in “src” folder
3. Create a user-defined namespace and use the same for all shapes
4. .h file → contains a class → class: private members and public member functions + ctor/dtor (declaration only)
5. .cpp file → includes the .h file + using its namespace → definition of functions
6. Main.cpp → has the entry point → include all .h files
7. Create an “output” folder for .exe file
8. Mention the file paths in .vscode>>tasks.json file correctly.
9. Build the project and execute.
